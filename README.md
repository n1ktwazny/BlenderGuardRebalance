Hi,

The mod updates almost every important stat to make the mixed towers viable later in the game,
There are too many changes to go over every single one, but you can actually see the full list
if you dig through the code like a champ.
(or play with config files)

The main things this mod changes:
- DPS of damaging towers,
- Q generation of towers,
- HP-Regen relations,
- Tower cost scaling
- And simple difficulty scaling by making enemies faster over time

It also partially implements an alternate custom stats system, but it's not too functional.

Using the other mods in the BlenderGuardian collection (eg. Guide+ and General Fixes) is highly advised for the best experience
